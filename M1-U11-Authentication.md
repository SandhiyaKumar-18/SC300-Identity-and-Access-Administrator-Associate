# Explore Authentication

## Overview
Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user, application, or device to ensure they are who they claim to be. Authentication also ensures an appropriate level of security throughout the authentication transaction.

### Identity Authentication Provides:
- **Flexible, standards-compliant authentication** that integrates across organizations.
- **Integration of disparate sources, applications, and protocols**.
- **Support for multiple industry-standard methods** of validation and assurance.

Using an **identity provider** for authentication ensures secure identities without limiting user capabilities. Benefits include:
- **Convenience:** Enhances the end-user experience during authentication.
- **Multiple identity sources:** Supports federated identity for seamless integration.
- **Support for standard authentication protocols:** Ensures secure authentication.
- **Authentication assurance:** Increases confidence that the user accessing a resource is legitimate.

## Federated Identity
Federation refers to a collection of domains that have established trust. This trust typically includes **authentication** and often includes **authorization**. Federation enables organizations to use existing identities from trusted sources, like an **on-premises Active Directory**.

## Common Authentication Protocols
| Protocol | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** | Open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. |
| **WS-Federation (WS-Fed)** | Identity specification within the Web Services Security framework that provides SSO using external identity exchange and authentication. |
| **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** | An authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0 that enables secure sign-in and single sign-on (SSO) to applications. |

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)
OIDC is an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0 that provides:
- Secure sign-in to applications.
- ID token issuance, which allows a client to verify a user's identity.
- The **UserInfo endpoint**, an API that provides user profile details.

## Claims-Based Identity in Microsoft Entra ID
When a user signs in, **Microsoft Entra ID** issues an **ID token** containing **claims** about the user. 

### What is a Claim?
A **claim** is a key-value pair that represents information about the user, such as:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe"
}

### How Claims-Based Authentication Works:
1. **User authentication occurs.**  
2. The **Identity Provider issues an ID token** with a set of claims.  
3. The **application processes the claims.**  
4. The **application grants access** based on the claims.

## Security Tokens

Microsoft Entra ID issues **security tokens** to authorize access to resources. The three most common types of tokens are:

### 1. **Access Token**
- Used to grant access to APIs and protected resources.  
- Issued by an **authorization server**.  
- Contains information about the user and the target resource.  

### 2. **Refresh Token**
- Used to obtain a **new access token** when the current one expires.  
- Increases security by reducing the number of authentication prompts.  

### 3. **ID Token**
- Issued during **OIDC authentication**.  
- Verifies the identity of the authenticated user.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a compact and self-contained way to transmit authentication and authorization data. JWTs are **digitally signed** and contain three main parts:

### **1. Header (Algorithm & Token Type)**
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
2. Payload (Claims)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "aud": "https://jwt.io"
}
3. Signature (Ensures integrity)
JWT Benefits:
Secure transmission of authentication details.

Compact format, making them efficient for web and API authentication.

Digitally signed to prevent tampering.

Definitions in Claims-Based Identity
Term	Definition
Claim	A key-value pair representing identity information.
Assertion	A data package (token) that shares identity details across security domains.
Attribute	A key-value pair of data in a token.
Augmentation	The process of adding additional claims to a token for extra details.
Summary
Authentication is a critical part of identity management. Microsoft Entra ID provides a flexible and secure authentication framework with support for:

Federated identities

Authentication protocols

Security tokens

Claims-based identity

These features ensure safe and seamless user access.

# Claims-Based Authentication in Microsoft Entra ID

## Claims Trust and Authentication Flow

Claims are trusted because they are issued by a trusted **Identity Provider (IdP)**.

### How Claims-Based Authentication Works:
1. **User authentication occurs.**
2. The **Identity Provider issues an ID token** with a set of claims.
3. The **application processes the claims.**
4. The **application grants access** based on the claims.

- Used to obtain a **new access token** when the current one expires.
- Increases security by **reducing the number of authentication prompts**.

### 3. **ID Token**
- Issued during **OIDC authentication**.
- Verifies the **identity of the authenticated user**.
